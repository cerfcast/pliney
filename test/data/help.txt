./build/pliney Usage:
./build/pliney [OPTIONS] [ \!\> [<PLUGIN_INVOCATION> =\>]

Using pliney involves writing a pipeline that will generate (a) packet(s)
for the network. Pipelines begin with a \!\> and are composed of uses of
plugins, separated by =\>. General, optional OPTIONS can be given to
configure pliney before the pipeline. More information can be found in the
online documentation at XXXXX

OPTIONS: 
	--type <dgram, stream>: To set whether pliney should send
		the packets the pipeline generates over a stream- or 
		datagram-oriented socket.
	--log <debug, warn, trace, error>: To set the log level.
	--plugin-path PATH_NAME: Filesystem path where pliney should
		look for plugins

PLUGIN_INVOCATION:
	<PLUGIN_NAME> [plugin options ... see below]

Plugin Usage:
	body
		<FILE_PATH> [SIZE]
		Usage:
		Replace the existing body of the packet with the contents of
		FILE_PATH. SIZE (in bytes), if given, caps the size of the
		new body. If SIZE is not specified, the entire contents of
		FILE_PATH will be used.
	cong
		<ect1, ect0, ce, not-ect>
		Usage:
		Set the congestion value of the DSCP field to the specified
		value.
	diffserv
		<cs0, cs1, cs2, cs3, cs4, cs5, cs6, cs7
		af11, af12, af13,
		af21, af22, af23,
		af31, af32, af33,
		af41, af42, af43,
		ef, voice-admit>
		Usage:
		Set the differentiated services value of the DSCP field to
		the specified value.
	hoplimit
		<HL>
		Usage:
		Set the hoplimit on the packet to HL.
	log
		[-mode <overwrite, append>]
		[-default-ip <IP>]
		[-default-transport <dgram, stream>] <FILE_PATH>
		Usage:
		Write the contents of the packet to FILE_PATH in PCAP format.
		Optionally specify a mode to determine how existing contents
		of FILE_PATH are handled. Optionally specify a default-ip to
		specify a target IP if the packet does not have one. Optionally
		specify a default-transport protocol if the packet does not have
		one.
	raw
		[-mode <overwrite, append>] <file path>
		Usage:
		Write the contents of the body of the packet to <file path>.
		Optionally specify a mode to determine how existing contents
		of <file path> are handled.
	target
		<IP or HOSTNAME> [PORT]
		Usage:
		Set the target address of the packet to IP or the address
		resolved from a DNS lookup of HOSTNAME. The packet's
		existing target port will only be overwritten if PORT
		is specified.
	transport
		<udp,tcp>
		Usage:
		TODO
	ttl
		<TTL>
		Usage:
		Set the time to live on the packet to TTL.
