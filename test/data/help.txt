./build/pliney Usage:
./build/pliney [OPTIONS] [ \!\> [<PLUGIN_INVOCATION> =\>]

Using pliney involves writing a pipeline that will generate (a) packet(s)
for the network. Pipelines begin with a \!\> and are composed of uses of
plugins, separated by =\>. General, optional OPTIONS can be given to
configure pliney before the pipeline. More information can be found in the
online documentation at XXXXX

OPTIONS: 
	--type <dgram, stream>: To set whether pliney should send
		the packets the pipeline generates over a stream- or 
		datagram-oriented socket.
	--log <debug, warn, trace, error>: To set the log level.
	--plugin-path PATH_NAME: Filesystem path where pliney should
		look for plugins

PLUGIN_INVOCATION:
	<PLUGIN_NAME> [plugin options ... see below]

Plugin Usage:
	body
		<FILE_PATH> [SIZE]
		Usage:
		Replace the existing body of the packet with the contents of
		FILE_PATH. SIZE (in bytes), if given, caps the size of the
		new body. If SIZE is not specified, the entire contents of
		FILE_PATH will be used.
	cong
		<ect1, ect0, ce, not-ect>
		Usage:
		Set the congestion value of the DSCP field to the specified
		value.
	diffserv
		<cs0, cs1, cs2, cs3, cs4, cs5, cs6, cs7
		af11, af12, af13,
		af21, af22, af23,
		af31, af32, af33,
		af41, af42, af43,
		ef, voice-admit>
		Usage:
		Set the differentiated services value of the DSCP field to
		the specified value.
	exthdr-padn
		<dst, hbh> <SIZE> [BYTE]
		Usage:
		Add a PadN option to the destination or hop-by-hop
		dst, hbh, respectively) IPv6 extension header with the
		specified SIZE. Optionally specify the value of the
		BYTEs in the padding. User is responsible for
		guaranteeing that the sizes of all extension headers
		meet alignment and other requirements.
	gre
		<IP or HOSTNAME>
		Usage:
		Encapsulate the packet in a GRE tunnel to the specified IP
		or HOSTNAME.
	hoplimit
		<HL>
		Usage:
		Set the hoplimit on the packet to HL.
	icmp
		<echo> [TYPE_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS]
		Usage:
		Create an ICMP packet with the given type. Depending on
		the type, TYPE_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS will be different:
		echo: [ID] [SEQUENCE]
		      The id and sequence in the request packet.
		extended-echo: [ID] [SEQUENCE]
		               The id and sequence in the request packet.
	icmp-extension
		<probe, environment> [TYPE_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS]
		Usage:
		Create the ICMP extension object with the given type to
		be placed in an ICMP packet. Depending on the type,
		TYPE_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS will be:
		probe: INTERFACE_NAME
		       The interface name for which to probe.
		environment: [PRESENT] [IDLE]
		             The present and idle power of the host.
	lua
		<FILE_PATH>
		Usage:
		With the socket configured according to the pipeline (seen
		so far, execute the lua code contained in FILE_PATH. The
		socket variable is _G.PLINEY_SOCKET.
	meta
		<udp,tcp>
		Usage:
		TODO
	raw
		[-mode <overwrite, append>] <file path>
		Usage:
		Write the contents of the body of the packet to <file path>.
		Optionally specify a mode to determine how existing contents
		of <file path> are handled.
	source
		<IP or HOSTNAME> [PORT]
		Usage:
		Set the source address of the packet to IP or the address
		resolved from a DNS lookup of HOSTNAME. The packet's
		existing target port will only be overwritten if PORT
		is specified.
	target
		<IP or HOSTNAME> [PORT]
		Usage:
		Set the target address of the packet to IP or the address
		resolved from a DNS lookup of HOSTNAME. The packet's
		existing target port will only be overwritten if PORT
		is specified.
	transport
		<udp,tcp,icmp>
		Usage:
		TODO
	ttl
		<TTL>
		Usage:
		Set the time to live on the packet to TTL.
